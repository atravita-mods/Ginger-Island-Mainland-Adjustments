Changelog
===================

#### Todo

1. Add closer points for explorer schedules, 5PM the south part of IslandNorth 
4. Nonreplacing dialogue for the Resort keys? (flatten the ones that already exist, but add a way to add more that's less likely to clobber)
5. // TODO: put the switch case back for GusDay in case people can't spell.
