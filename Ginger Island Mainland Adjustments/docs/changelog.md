Changelog
===================

[← back to readme](../../README.md)

#### Todo

1. Make groups more meaningful.
2. Nonreplacing dialogue for the Resort keys? (flatten the ones that already exist, but add a way to add more that's less likely to clobber).
3. Handle roommates, like actually.
4. Let Pam fish. (tile 21,44 seems reasonable)
<!-- Finish the locations console command -->

##### Known Issues

1. NPCs may vanish if they go to IslandSouthEast. They reappear the next day. Therefore, that's been tempoarily removed until I figure out why they disappear from IslandSouthEast. IslandNorth is fine.

### Version 1.1.1

* Fix issue where spouses would say their `GI_Leave` lines a day after they were supposed to.

### Version 1.1.0

* Initial upload.
