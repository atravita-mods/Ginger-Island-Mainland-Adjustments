Changelog
===================

[← back to readme](../../README.md)

#### Todo

1. Make groups more meaningful.
2. Nonreplacing dialogue for the Resort keys? (flatten the ones that already exist, but add a way to add more that's less likely to clobber).
3. Handle roommates, like actually.
<!-- Finish the locations console command: take a location as the argument and filter to just locations that match at the first/last location?-->
<!-- Also, add in a resort line for Leo.... -->
<!-- "Barfolk": "Clint, Willy", if Willy is enabled. -->
<!-- More schedule debugging tools: get arbitrary schedule from X day? -->

##### Known Issues

1. NPCs may vanish if they go to IslandSouthEast. They reappear the next day. Therefore, that's been tempoarily removed until I figure out why they disappear from IslandSouthEast. IslandNorth is fine.
