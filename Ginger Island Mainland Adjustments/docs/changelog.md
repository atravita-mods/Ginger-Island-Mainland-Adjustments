Changelog
===================

#### Todo

1. Make groups more meaningful.
2. Nonreplacing dialogue for the Resort keys? (flatten the ones that already exist, but add a way to add more that's less likely to clobber).
3. Handle roommates, like actually.
4. Check to see if adding Sandy as a possible resort attendee breaks anything. If not, make a config for it.

### Version 1.1.0

* Initial upload.
